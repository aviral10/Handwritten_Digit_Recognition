# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Website: 
https://handwritten-digit-recognition-eight.vercel.app/

### Instructions:
- Draw a single digit on the Canvas and let the model predict the drawn digit
- Click on Visualize in 3D to view the 3D model displaying the intermediate outputs.


## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```

### Bugs:
- The canvas might not respond when you draw on it the first time, works fine afterwards.
